# My Portfolio

My portfolio website, created using React, Next.js, Adobe XD and [Mokup Frames](https://www.mokupframes.com/)

> Note: There is no reason whatsoever to use React and/or Next.js for this project, I just wanted to try out Next.js' SSG (Static Site Generation) feature on a GitHub-Pages deployment 
> 
> (Hint: make sure to add a .nojekyll in your build folder...)
